# Cincinnati Car Crash Forecasting

To evaluate and compare multiple time series forecasting methods applied to Cincinnati traffic crash data, and ultimately identify the most accurate and reliable model for predicting future crash counts.

## Tech Stack

**Forecasting Models:** Naive, Seasonal Naive,oving Averages, ARIMA, SARIMA,Prophet,

**Language:** Python

**Libraries:**

pandas, numpy – data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn – visualization

statsmodels – statistical modeling (e.g., SARIMA)

scikit-learn – preprocessing & metrics

**Platform:** Jupyter / Quarto (HTML output)

## Lessons Learned

**Time Series Modeling:** Gained hands-on experience with SARIMA and Prophet models, understanding their strengths and weaknesses in real-world forecasting.

**Cross-Validation Design:** Learned how to implement rolling forecast evaluation, which simulates real forecasting more realistically than static test splits.

**Model Selection:** Discovered that the most accurate model isn't always the best across all forecast horizons—context matters.

**Interpretation of Forecast Errors:** Understood how residual analysis reveals systematic model limitations like bias or over-smoothing.
